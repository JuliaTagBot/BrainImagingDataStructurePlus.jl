Possible values: `i`, `j`, `k`, `i-`, `j-`, `k-`. The letters `i`, `j`, `k`
correspond to the first, second and third axis of the data in the NIFTI file.
The polarity of the phase encoding is assumed to go from zero index to maximum
index unless `-` sign is present (then the order is reversed - starting from
the highest index instead of zero). `PhaseEncodingDirection` is defined as the
direction along which phase is was modulated which may result in visible
distortions. Note that this is not the same as the DICOM term
`InPlanePhaseEncodingDirection` which can have `ROW` or `COL` values. This
parameter is REQUIRED if corresponding fieldmap data is present or when using
multiple runs with different phase encoding directions (which can be later used
for field inhomogeneity correction).

    effective_echo_spacing

The "effective" sampling interval, specified in seconds, between lines in the
phase-encoding direction, defined based on the size of the reconstructed image
in the phase direction. It is frequently, but incorrectly, referred to as
"dwell time" (see `DwellTime` parameter below for actual dwell time). It is
required for unwarping distortions using field maps. Note that beyond just
in-plane acceleration, a variety of other manipulations to the phase encoding
need to be accounted for properly, including partial fourier, phase
oversampling, phase resolution, phase field-of-view and interpolation.<sup>2</sup>
This parameter is REQUIRED if corresponding fieldmap data is present.                                                                                                                  |

1/\[`BWPPPE` \* `ReconMatrixPE`\], where BWPPPE is the
"`BandwidthPerPixelPhaseEncode` in DICOM tag (0019,1028) and ReconMatrixPE is
the size of the actual reconstructed data in the phase direction (which is NOT
reflected in a single DICOM tag for all possible aforementioned scan

    total_readout_time

This is actually the "effective" total readout time , defined as the readout
duration, specified in seconds, that would have generated data with the given
level of distortion. It is NOT the actual, physical duration of the readout
train. If `EffectiveEchoSpacing` has been properly computed, it is just
`EffectiveEchoSpacing * (ReconMatrixPE - 1)`.<sup>3</sup> .
