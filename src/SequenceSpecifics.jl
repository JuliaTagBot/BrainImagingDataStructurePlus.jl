    SequenceSpecifics

The `SequenceSpecifics` module is intended only for implementing an API for
other formats to interact and exchange scanner sequence specific information.
It is intended to be robust and sufficient, as opposed to comprehensive
coverage of sequence design elements. All methods are exported and no
structures are defined.
